This is portfolio project to build a basic calculator GUI with basic functionalites. Functionalities include calculation decimal numbers, addition, multiplication, division and subtraction. You can also delete numbers in case you have entered a wrong number. To close the GUI, you can simply click on the 'OFF' button.

## How to run

1. Download the code file 'calculator.py'.

2. Open your desired command line. If you have python installed in your computer, you may use command prompt or software such as Visual Studio Code. In this example, I will be running it using anaconda prompt.

3. If you are using a command prompt, make sure to set the correct file path. It should have the following template: 'cd filepath_of_code'
